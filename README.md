# DeepLearningSnake

A project meant to showcase various forms of unsupervised learning in the form of one or more models learning to play Snake.

Currently, I have PyTorch and Tensorflow versions for Python that utilize Pygame for the Snake game itself. The forms of deep learning available are deep genetic algorithm and deep q learning.

I'm working on a C++ version as well. Currently, I'm just working on building a neural network using Eigen. Once I have that done, I'll work to build the actual Snake environment, likely using Godot.
